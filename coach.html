However, despite the availability of personal metrics, people continue to struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

                                My team and I brainstormed a strategy to find out why people weren’t reaching their fitness goals. We made interviews and a survey to gather enough data for our research. We wanted to know how people defined healthy living, their efforts to achieve that lifestyle, their goals, and frustrations. Our main takeaway was that <strong>most people want to live a healthy lifestyle but don’t feel motivated enough to make it a priority.</strong>

                                    I kept in mind where our users preferred working out when tackling the issue of accessibility.  Since the majority of our subjects said they got their fitness information from people more advanced than them. We concluded that other than accountability, learning from a trustworthy source was a key element for our users. We deduced that for our app to motivate the user, it had to cater to their personal needs and be an authoritative source of information.

                                                    <strong>Pete</strong> thinks he doesn’t have enough time to be fit. He only works out if someone pushes him to. On weekdays, he stays late at the office and, on weekends, he hangs out with his buddies. Every week he promises himself to start exercising on Monday. But he never follows through because he has a hangover. Pete really doesn't want to go to the gym. He prefers lingering at the office working or with his friends drinking beer and eating buffalo wings. He’s insecure about his body and gets self-conscious around fitter types in the gym.

He wakes up at 4am to go to the gym but feels stuck doing the same routines without achieving greater results. He wants to eat better but doesn’t know how. Keeping an eye on his long long-term is also important. He once wanted to compete but now feels discouraged and bored.

                                        We did research on competitors and learned that few fitness app gave users personalized exercise options and most only worked as trackers. One of the few that offered personal options was <a href="http://fitstar.com/">Fitstart</a>, but it had the shortcoming of not overseeing the user’s form. This oversight would have led Pete or Matt to injure themselves. Another app that was not just a tracker was <a href="http://www.thefabulous.co/">The Fabulous</a>, which worked as a motivator to help the user build healthy habits. Its problem was that it only focused on broader solutions, it didn't offer targeted, individualized options. Giving Pete and Matt's options based on their goals without losing sight of the root causes adds value to our app and gives us an edge in the market.

                                    We felt that Pete is struggling more than Matt establishing a healthy life. Helping Pete became our primary concern and main focus since making a product for him benefits Matt as well. Each of us came up with a few concepts, discussed them and then singled one out for testing. With a series of interviews, we pointed out which concept pushed Pete into action and why. (chosen concepts are bold)

                                        My app relied too much on the onboarding process and didn't have a clear language. It initially led people to think that Pete had to join a group to work out. David’s and Misaki’s app did make Pete join a group. My app encouraged Pete to enroll in exciting activities he can do on his own like diving, biking, and other gym alternatives. Optionally he’ll meet health-oriented people and become more health-oriented by association.

                                        Users reacted positively to how David, Misaki, and my app offered fun and different alternatives to the gym. But disliked how David and Misaki’s app made Pete join groups in order to work out. We know that Pete can be sociable, but forcing him from the start to be social in an exercising environment will be uncomfortable and unappealing.

                                        Interviewees felt that Jared’s app was easy to use and navigate.

Most testers felt that having a personal trainer checking in motivates Pete.
